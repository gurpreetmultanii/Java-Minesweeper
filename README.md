# Java-Minesweeper

## Description 

Built using Java and applied object-oriented programming principles to handle game data and manage complex logic. Daleks is a simple game that allows users to navigate around the 12 by 12 grid and attempt to crash the Daleks. When all the Daleks have crashed into each other, the user wins the game. If the user crashes into one of the Daleks, the user loses. The user can also teleport to a random point by clicking anywhere on the board.
